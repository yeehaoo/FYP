# FYP - Lab Automation System

This project aimed to design and develop a data acquisition system using LabVIEW with communication protocol such as the Message Queueing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) to transmit the sensors data to the HMI system. Sensors were used to detect temperature and light in the lab, and the data would be sent to the cloud via MQTT protocol. A remote HMI system would then receive the data, interpret it, and send commands to the client to activate the actuators. While the objectives of the project were achieved, a greater number of features could be added with the availability of different types of sensors.

This project was completed on 1 February 2019 as a Major Project.
